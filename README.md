# Database_Management_System_GUI
 
While working on this project, i implemented a code to demonstrate actions that involve a database. More specifically, the following actions are supported :
* Insertion
* Delete
* Update
* Print Data
* Enable Trigger
* Export to Excel

This project has been mainly focused on basic actions of database. However, there are some ideas that i would like to implement. 
For example :
* Data Analysis & Graphs
